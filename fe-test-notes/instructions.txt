We want to create some part of our Client Application, the application is web-based, mobile-first and fully responsive.

That includes 2 screens,
the first screen has a dynamic list of grades that can be fetched remotely, the user can choose one or multiple days and a time range,
clicking on "Create Bookings" will take the user to the second screen.

The second screen shows a list of bookings to be created based on the date and times selected in the previous screen and staff available for each booking.

Instructions:

The list of grades must be fetched remotely: https://static.healthforcego.com/grades.json
Clicking on "Create bookings" on the first screen should retrieve a list of available staff, for that exercise you will generate them randomly.
Clicking on "Confirm bookings" on the second screen should post the data to a server, for that exercise you will console.log the data.


Deliverables:

- Use of React Components.
- Use of state management.
- Some Unit Tests if possible.
- Feel free to use any framework or library you want, and enhance it as much as possible.

- Send your project in a zip file with all the instructions to install, run....

Good Luck
